# Cosmic Match

Memory games are an entertaining way to improve one's memory, concentration, and attention to detail. Even though it can be as beneficial to small children as to adults, most games are designed for children. 

That's when **Cosmic Match** comes into play. It's a simple memory game that uses star constellations as images to be matched and provides an overall nice feel to the game. Using real star constellation might further enable the player to recognize star constellations in the night sky in real life.

The player is presented with 12 cards turned on their back. When the player clicks on the card, it's front is displayed, which should be memorized by the user to find the matching pairs. Each turn two cards are flipped and either matched or turned back for another try. Goal of the game is to match all cards before the time runs out.

## User Experience (UX)
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

They have not been amended since the repository has been created and, therefore, display small differences when compared to the live website.

## Testing !!!

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

### Deploy project

My project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To do so, I completed the steps below:

1. Navigated to my repository "cosmic-match"
2. Clicked on **Settings**
3. Under **GitHub Pages**, I used the **Source** drop-down menu and selected "master branch"
4. Clicked on **Save**

Once done, GitHub displayed the following message: "Your site is published at https://anabelalealcosta19.github.io/cosmic-match/". I clicked on the link and could confirm that the website was successfully deployed. 

### Deployed vs development version

My Github Pages site is built from the master brand. All changes have been saved, committed and pushed. Therefore, there should be no differences between the deployed and the development version.  

### Run code locally

To run code locally, the remote Github repository needs to be cloned. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point, including every file and folder of the project. Changes can be pushed to the remote Github repository at any time.

Find below the necessary steps to be able to run the code locally. The default instructions relate to Windows, any differences for Mac and Linux have been added in brackets. 

#### Cloning a repository using the command line
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
1. Under the repository name, click **Clone or download**.
1. **Clone with HTTPS**: Click on the clipboard symbol beside the web URL to clone the repository using HTTPS. To clone using a SSH key (or certificate issued by the SSH certificate authority), click **Use SSH** and then the clipboard symbol.
1. Open Git Bash [*Mac & Linux: Open Terminal*].
1. Change the current working directory to the location you want the cloned directory. 
1. Type **git clone** and paste the URL you copied in step 3.
1. Press enter to create the local clone.

#### Cloning a repository to GitHub Desktop
1. Sign in to GitHub and GitHub Desktop before you start to clone.
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
1. Under the repository name, click **Clone or download**.
1. **Clone with HTTPS**: Click on **Open in Desktop** to clone the repository and open it in GitHub Desktop.
1. Click **"Choose..."** and navigate to a local path where you want to clone the repository.
1. Click **Clone** to create the local clone.

### Acknowledgments

While I  decided to create a memory game, I got the inspiration for the overall theme from my partner Glen Harris. He has always been truly fascinated by astronomy and stars in particular. When looking at the different constellations at night, I had the idea to combine this with my second project. 

A special thanks to my mentor [Rahul Lakhanpal](https://github.com/rahulkp220), who has provided me with valuable insights into best practices when building a game as well as writing automated testing. I furthermore want to thank the slack community of Code Institute for reviewing my project and providing me with constructive criticism.
